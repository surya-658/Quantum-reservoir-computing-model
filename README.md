# Quantum-reservoir-computing-model

This is a quantum reservior computing model which is used for time series predcitions 
This model iteratively applies a set of quantum gates on the sequential data so that the data evolves 
from this evolved data new features are extracted and are used for training the model 

The data set used is the  Statlog German Credit Data

The model outperformed the classical counter parts which are SVM , gradient boost and random forest
